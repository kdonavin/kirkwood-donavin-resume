Personal Statement

I love using data science to support intelligent business decisions. I thrive in a 
team of quantitative professionals and mentors, who in turn encourage my growth 
as a data scientist. I am able to query, clean, visualize, analyze and predict with 
statistical rigor and I am enthusiastic about problem-solving with programming 
languages.
